## Features

- Automatic current EuroLeague season detection
- Automatic current regular-season round detection
- Standings from the EuroLeague public API
- Team logos from EuroLeague club data
- Points for, points against and point differential calculated from played regular-season games
- Persistent last-known standings cache that survives Home Assistant restarts
- Cached standings remain visible during temporary EuroLeague API failures
- Supplemental clubs / games API failures do not take the main standings offline
- Endpoint-specific warning logs for easier API troubleshooting
- Sensor: `sensor.euroleague_standings`
- Bundled `custom:euroleague-standings-card`
- Automatic Lovelace resource registration in storage mode
- Visual card editor in English
- Configurable TOP N, favorite team, Playoff / Play-In zones, team-logo mode, header mode, GP and +/- columns
- Three card density modes: **Normal**, **Compact** and **Super compact**
- HACS compatible

## Installation with HACS

Use the **Open in HACS** button above for one-click setup.

Manual fallback:

1. HACS → Integrations → three dots → Custom repositories.
2. Add `https://github.com/braticks/euroleague-standings` as **Integration**.
3. Install **EuroLeague Standings**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → **EuroLeague Standings**.
6. Add **EuroLeague Standings Card** from the dashboard card picker.

No separate HACS Dashboard repository is required from version 1.2.0 onward.

If the old `euroleague-standings-card` Dashboard repository was previously installed, update this integration first, restart Home Assistant, verify the card works, then the separate Dashboard repository can be removed from HACS.

### Manual YAML example

```yaml
type: custom:euroleague-standings-card
entity: sensor.euroleague_standings
count: 10
favorite_team: ZAL
always_show_favorite: true
team_logo_mode: background
header_style: logo
show_round: true
show_gp: false
show_diff: true
show_zones: true
density: super_compact
highlight_favorite: true
```

`density` accepts `normal`, `compact` or `super_compact`. Super compact mode uses smaller rows, logos and text, and hides the GP column, zone divider labels and legend to minimize card height.

Legacy configurations using `compact: true` are automatically treated as `density: compact`.

## Reliability and cached data

The integration stores the latest usable standings in Home Assistant storage.

If the EuroLeague API is temporarily unavailable, the previous standings remain available instead of the sensor immediately becoming `unavailable`. This also works after a Home Assistant restart once at least one successful update has been cached.

Useful sensor attributes:

- `data_stale: true` — the integration is currently showing cached standings because the required API data could not be refreshed.
- `partial_data: true` — the main standings are fresh, but supplemental clubs or games data failed to refresh.
- `partial_errors` — shows which supplemental request failed.
- `last_error` — contains the most recent full-update error while cached standings are being used.

## Lovelace YAML resource mode

The integration registers the card automatically when Lovelace resources use storage mode. If resources are managed in YAML, add this module manually:

```yaml
url: /euroleague_standings/euroleague-standings-card.js
resource_type: module
```

## Sensor data

The `teams` attribute contains position, team code, name, logo, games played, wins, losses, `points_for`, `points_against` and `points_diff`.
